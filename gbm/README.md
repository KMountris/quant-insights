## GBM

### Introduction
This notebook impelements the solution of the geometric Brownian motion process for the simulation of stock price.

### What you will learn

* What is a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and how it is implemented
* How to numerically approximate the GBM using Euler-Maruyama and Milstein schemes
* What is the accuracy of the two schemes and how it is affected by stock price parameters such as the volatility coefficient
